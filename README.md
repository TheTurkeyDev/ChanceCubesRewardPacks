This repository contains custom reward packs for the Minecraft mod Chance Cubes.

To use or install these packs, you can download the pack on curse forge, or here on github if you prefer(Note the versions on github are constantly being worked on and are not guaranteed to be stable, or balanced). Usually the installation process consists of coping or unzipping the downloaded files into the config/ChanceCubes/CustomRewards folder.

Feel free to make pull requests with changes and/or additions that you feel fit the style of these packs!

All packs are recognized and supported by the mod and the author.
